## About the portafolio

This version of my portafolio uses react as a framework. The information about my resume and my proyects are stored in a json file that is imported by de elments to display the information in the adecuate place so any adition to the json automaticly updates the layout.

There is a menu element acting as a header with the routes for all the pages.

The portafolio is fully responsive so it can be displayed in a mobil device with a stylized layout.

For the styling i used *bulma*, *fontawesome* but mostly pure css and flex box to make the elements responsive..
